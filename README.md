Both versions of Wordle randomly select words from 5letterwords.txt.

## Text Version: 
- wordleText.py
- 5letterwords.txt

Must be in the same folder to run.

## PySimpleGUI Version: 
- pySimpleWordle.py 
- wordleFunctions.py
- 5letterwords.txt

Must be in the same folder to run. 

pySimpleWordle.py is the main file, which uses logic from wordleFunctions.py.
